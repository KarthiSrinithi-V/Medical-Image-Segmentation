# Medical Image Segmentation Using U-Net

üìå **Implementing U-Net Architecture for Medical Image Segmentation**

üîç **Project Overview**

Medical image segmentation plays a crucial role in the field of healthcare by helping in the accurate identification of regions of interest, such as tumors or organs, from medical images. This project leverages **U-Net**, a powerful convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture designed for efficient image segmentation, to address this challenge.

The main objective of this project is to implement a **U-Net model** that performs **binary segmentation** on synthetic images. These images simulate medical data and contain circular features, which serve as simple analogs for real-world regions like organs or lesions. The project emphasizes building and training a U-Net model that can accurately segment these features, simulating how it would perform on actual medical images.

‚öôÔ∏è **Technologies Used**

- **Python**: The core programming language used to build the model.
- **TensorFlow & Keras**: The deep learning libraries used to implement and train the U-Net model.
- **OpenCV**: Used for generating synthetic images and masks with circular features.
- **Matplotlib**: Visualizing model performance, including loss curves and segmentation results.
- **scikit-learn**: Used for data splitting and model evaluation metrics.

üéØ **Project Features and Output**

This project is designed to provide both functional insights and practical application of medical image segmentation techniques.

- **Synthetic Data Generation**: The model is tested on synthetic data that mimics medical images with circular structures.
- **U-Net Model Implementation**: The U-Net architecture is implemented to segment the circular regions effectively.
- **Training & Evaluation**: The model is trained on synthetic data and evaluated on its ability to segment these circular features.
- **Visualization of Results**: Post-training, the model‚Äôs performance is visualized through a series of plots showing:
  - Training and validation loss curves.
  - Predicted masks alongside ground truth for visual comparison.
- **Optimized Training**: The training process includes techniques like early stopping, learning rate scheduling, and model checkpointing to ensure efficient learning and avoid overfitting.
